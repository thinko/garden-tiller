# IPMI Cipher Error Filtering Solution

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a solution to filter out benign "Unable to Get Channel Cipher Suites" errors that appear when using ipmitool commands in the Garden-Tiller project.

## Problem Description

When executing ipmitool commands, a benign error message "Unable to Get Channel Cipher Suites" frequently appears in stderr. This message:

- Does not affect the actual functionality of ipmitool commands
- Always appears regardless of command success or failure
- Can cause confusion in logs and output
- May trigger false alarms in monitoring systems

## Solution Components

### 1. Ansible Filter Plugin (`filter_plugins/ipmi_filters.py`)

A custom Ansible filter plugin that provides functions to:

- `clean_ipmi_stderr`: Remove benign cipher suite errors from stderr text
- `ipmi_has_real_errors`: Check if stderr contains actual errors (not just cipher suite messages)
- `ipmi_extract_useful_info`: Process command results with cleaned stderr information

**Usage in playbooks:**
```yaml
- name: Debug filtered stderr
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: 
      - "Raw stderr: {{ command_result.stderr }}"
      - "Cleaned stderr: {{ command_result.stderr | clean_ipmi_stderr }}"
      - "Has real errors: {{ command_result.stderr | ipmi_has_real_errors }}"
```

### 2. IPMI Wrapper Script (`scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh`)

A bash script wrapper that:

- Executes ipmitool commands with proper error handling
- Filters stderr output to remove cipher suite errors
- Provides fallback messages for failed commands
- Returns appropriate exit codes based on real errors

**Usage:**
```bash
./ipmi_wrapper.sh <bmc_address> <username> <password> "<command>" "[fallback_message]"
```

**Example:**
```bash
./ipmi_wrapper.sh 10.9.1.51 admin password "fru print" "FRU_COLLECTION_FAILED"
```

### 3. Consolidated IPMI Playbook (`playbooks/02-enumerate-ipmi.yaml`)

The IPMI enumeration playbook has been enhanced with:

- Uses the wrapper script for all ipmitool commands for consistent cipher error filtering
- Provides cleaner output with filtered stderr throughout all IPMI operations
- Includes comprehensive debug information and error handling
- Maintains compatibility with existing processing logic
- Consolidated from the previous enhanced version for simpler maintenance

**Key improvements:**
- All IPMI commands (FRU, hardware, sensors, power, boot, SEL) now use the wrapper script
- Consistent error filtering across all operations
- Better debug output and logging
- Enhanced error handling with proper fallback messages

## Implementation Details

### Error Patterns Filtered

The solution removes these benign error patterns from stderr:

- `Unable to Get Channel Cipher Suites`
- `Get Channel Cipher Suites command failed`

### Processing Logic

1. **Command Execution**: ipmitool commands are executed normally
2. **Stderr Filtering**: Benign errors are removed from stderr output
3. **Error Detection**: Only real errors are flagged for attention
4. **Fallback Handling**: Failed commands use predefined fallback messages
5. **Success Determination**: Commands are considered successful if:
   - Return code is 0, OR
   - stdout contains valid data AND stderr only has benign errors

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing playbook logic for processing stdout remains unchanged
- Fallback message patterns (`*_COLLECTION_FAILED`) are preserved
- Task failure behavior is maintained for real errors
- All existing variable processing continues to work

## Usage Examples

### Running with Enhanced Filtering

```bash
# Use the consolidated enhanced playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventories/test-hpe.yaml playbooks/02-enumerate-ipmi.yaml

# Enable verbose output to see filtering in action
ansible-playbook -i inventories/test-hpe.yaml playbooks/02-enumerate-ipmi.yaml -v
```

### Testing the Solution

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test
./scripts/test_ipmi_cipher_filtering.sh

# Test individual components
./scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh 10.9.1.51 admin password "fru print"
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Logs**: Removes noise from benign cipher suite errors
2. **Better Monitoring**: Only real errors trigger alerts
3. **Improved UX**: Less confusion for operators and administrators
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized error filtering logic
5. **Flexibility**: Can be extended to filter other benign errors

## Testing and Validation

The IPMI cipher error filtering has been thoroughly tested and validated:

- IPMI enumeration runs successfully with filtering enabled
- Logs show no cipher errors when using the wrapper script
- Real errors are preserved while benign errors are filtered
- End-to-end functionality verified across all playbooks

### Manual Testing

1. Run a single ipmitool command with the wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh <bmc_ip> <user> <pass> "fru print"
   ```

2. Compare stderr output with and without filtering:
   ```bash
   # Without filtering
   ipmitool -I lanplus -H <bmc_ip> -U <user> -P <pass> fru print
   
   # With filtering
   ./scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh <bmc_ip> <user> <pass> "fru print"
   ```

3. Test the filter plugin in a playbook:
   ```yaml
   - name: Test stderr filtering
     ansible.builtin.debug:
       msg: "{{ stderr_content | clean_ipmi_stderr }}"
   ```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Benign Error Patterns

To filter additional benign errors, update the patterns in:

1. `filter_plugins/ipmi_filters.py` - Update the `benign_patterns` list
2. `scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh` - Update the `filter_stderr()` function

### Monitoring Effectiveness

- Check logs for remaining cipher suite errors
- Monitor for new error patterns that need filtering
- Validate that real errors are still being caught

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Filter plugin not loading**: Ensure the plugin is in the correct directory
2. **Wrapper script not found**: Check file path and permissions
3. **Filtering not working**: Verify error patterns match actual stderr content

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test filter plugin directly
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('filter_plugins')
from ipmi_filters import clean_ipmi_stderr
print(clean_ipmi_stderr('Unable to Get Channel Cipher Suites\nReal error here'))
"

# Test wrapper script with debug
bash -x ./scripts/ipmi_wrapper.sh <args>
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configuration File**: Make error patterns configurable
2. **Metrics Collection**: Track filtering effectiveness
3. **Additional Tools**: Extend filtering to other BMC tools
4. **Integration**: Add filtering to other playbooks in the project
