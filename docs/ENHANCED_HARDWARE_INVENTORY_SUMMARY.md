  - Captures all new hardware component data
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing structure

- **Enhanced Data Structure:**
  - Added hardware summary with component counts
  - Individual component detail sections
  - Enhanced error handling and status reporting

### 4. Consolidated HTML Report Templates
- **Main Validation Report** (`playbooks/templates/main-validation-report.html.j2`):
  - Comprehensive overview of all validation results
  - Hardware Summary dashboard with component counts
  - Detailed OOBM, IPMI, Network, and Firmware sections
  - Interactive collapsible sections for detailed data
  - Modern responsive design with status indicators

- **Network Configuration Report** (`playbooks/templates/network-configuration-report.html.j2`):
  - Specialized network topology visualization
  - Detailed interface configuration and status
  - LACP test results and bonding information
  - Network discovery and performance metrics

- **Firmware Report** (`playbooks/templates/firmware_report.html.j2`):
  - Firmware compliance and validation details
  - Current vs expected version comparisons
  - Update recommendations and compliance status
  - USB Port configuration and device status
  - Enhanced iLO Management information

- **Improved Display Features:**
  - Color-coded status indicators (OK/Warning/Error)
  - Organized grid layout for better readability
  - Expandable sections for detailed component information
  - Health status highlighting with visual indicators

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevents cascading failures during hardware discovery
- **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff for transient connection issues
- **Graceful Degradation:** Continues collection even if some components fail
- **Fallback Methods:** XML endpoint and alternative discovery for iLO4/older systems

### Data Collection Strategy
1. **Primary:** Enhanced Redfish API collection for modern iLO systems
2. **Secondary:** XML endpoint parsing for iLO4 and older systems
3. **Tertiary:** Alternative methods including RIBCL and manual Redfish calls
4. **Fallback:** OS-level SSH collection for network adapters when BMC fails

### Hardware Summary Statistics
The enhanced system now provides comprehensive statistics:
- Total processors, cores, and threads
- Memory capacity and module counts
- Storage devices and SmartArray controllers
- Network adapters and HBA connections
- Power supplies and cooling fans
- USB ports and connectivity options

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test enhanced comprehensive inventory
python3 library/ilo_utils.py 192.168.1.100 admin password get_comprehensive_hardware_inventory_enhanced --redfish

# Test with fallback support
python3 library/ilo_utils.py 192.168.1.100 admin password get_comprehensive_hardware_inventory_with_fallback --redfish

# Test individual components
python3 library/ilo_utils.py 192.168.1.100 admin password get_smartarray_information --redfish
python3 library/ilo_utils.py 192.168.1.100 admin password get_power_supply_information --redfish
```

### Playbook Execution
```bash
# Run enhanced baseline collection
ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts.yaml playbooks/detailed-baseline-collection.yaml --tags=hardware,bmc,report
```

## Compatibility and Backward Compatibility
- **iLO Versions:** Supports iLO 4, iLO 5, and newer versions
- **Data Structure:** Maintains existing report compatibility while adding enhanced sections
- **Fallback Support:** Graceful degradation for older systems or partial API availability
- **Error Tolerance:** Continues operation even when advanced features are unavailable

## Benefits of Enhanced Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Visibility:** Complete hardware inventory across all server components
2. **Proactive Monitoring:** Health status and performance metrics for all components
3. **Capacity Planning:** Detailed specifications for upgrade and replacement planning
4. **Compliance Reporting:** Complete asset inventory with serial numbers and firmware versions
5. **Troubleshooting:** Detailed component information for rapid issue diagnosis
6. **Automation Ready:** Structured data format suitable for automated processing and alerting

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement
